# Outreact Message Generator

This was originally an outreach message generator but I have found other ways to compose such emails, hence, this part id no longeer necessary. You can still find the code in the repo.

I have created instead the other part of the sending of the Outreach message, the validation of the contact email addresses provided. This has been done using the Email Validation API from Absctract API https://app.abstractapi.com/api/email-validation/tester.

The toll has been deployed and has a monthly limit of 100 calls. I have not yet handled the error for that eventuality.
